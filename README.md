# heavenonline
This is the framework I use for my website, [heavenonline.xyz.](https://heavenonline.xyz/)  
Some demo pages and some admittedly lacking documentation in the form of readme files is also included.  
I'd like to write some better documentation eventually.  
  
This framework is designed for static websites with a large number of pages, with the goal of having the markup of an individual page be as short and compact as possible, at just about any cost. It is not a web app.  
  
You are free to do as you please with any and all of this, so long as attribution is provided.
