Subsites are basically "skins" for the site's skeleton.
Useful for themed regions of the site.
Check out /core/script.js to see everything they can do, as this example doesn't cover all of it.

To set the subsite on a page, make sure the first class of the <head> tag matches the name of the subsite.
Do not include the fullpath - use the name of the folder.
It should be set to "core" if no subsite is to be used.
